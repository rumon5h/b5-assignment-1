## Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.

* 1. any: The any type in TypeScript is a type that can represent any value. It is a way to opt-out of type checking for a variable. When you use any, you lose all the benefits of type safety, and TypeScript will not perform any checks on the value assigned to it. This can lead to runtime errors if the value does not match the expected type.
  
* 2. unknown: The unknown type is a safer alternative to any. It represents a value that could be of any type, but you cannot perform any operations on it until you perform some type checking. This means that you have to narrow down the type before using it, which helps maintain type safety.
  
* 3. never: The never type represents a value that never occurs. It is used to indicate that a function will never return a value, either because it always throws an error or because it has an infinite loop. It is a subtype of every type and can be used in places where you want to indicate that a certain code path will never be reached.
  
* For example, a function that always throws an error can be typed as returning never:
  
```ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
}

// This function will never return a value, as it always throws an error.
// It can be used in a switch statement to indicate that all cases have been handled:
function handleValue(value: string | number): void {
    switch (typeof value) {
        case "string":
            console.log("String value:", value);
            break;
        case "number":
            console.log("Number value:", value);
            break;
        default:
            // This case will never be reached, as all possible types have been handled
            throwError("Unexpected type");
    }
}

// handleValue("Hello");
// handleValue(42);
// handleValue(true); // This will cause a compile-time error, as boolean is not a valid type

```

* The never type is useful for indicating that a certain code path will never be reached, and it can help catch potential errors at compile time.
* The unknown type is useful for representing values of unknown types while still maintaining type safety, and it can help prevent runtime errors by requiring type checks before using the value.
* The any type is useful for cases where you need to opt-out of type checking, but it should be used sparingly as it can lead to runtime errors and loss of type safety.
* In summary, use any when you need to opt-out of type checking, use unknown when you want to represent a value of unknown type while maintaining type safety, and use never when you want to indicate that a certain code path will never be reached.


## What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.

* Enums in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based. Enums help to make the code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names to sets of related values.
* Numeric enums are the default type of enum in TypeScript. They are auto-incremented starting from 0 unless specified otherwise. String enums allow you to assign string values to the enum members.
* Here is an example of both numeric and string enums:

```ts
enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}
enum Color {
    Red = "RED",
    Green = "GREEN",
    Blue = "BLUE"
}


// console.log(Direction.Up); // Output: 1
// console.log(Direction.Down); // Output: 2
// console.log(Color.Red); // Output: "RED"
// console.log(Color.Green); // Output: "GREEN"
// console.log(Color.Blue); // Output: "BLUE"
```

* Enums are useful when you have a set of related constants that you want to group together. They can be used in switch statements, comparisons, and other scenarios where you need to work with a fixed set of values.
* Enums can also be used to define a set of named constants that can be used in place of magic numbers or strings, making the code more readable and maintainable. They can also be used to define a set of related values that can be used in switch statements or comparisons.
